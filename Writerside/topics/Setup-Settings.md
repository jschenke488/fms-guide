# Setup &amp; Settings

## Settings

On this page, you can configure authentication, networking, and match timing. You shouldn't need to change these settings.

## Team List

For a team to be able to connect, they must be added to the team list. Should be pre-configured with every team in Missouri and Kansas. If you need to add a team, use the "Import Teams" option.

## Field Testing

Used to play game sounds to test the audio. We do not use a PLC, so ignore the PLC information.

## SCC Status

Check the connection status of each SCC, and see if any e-stops are activated.
