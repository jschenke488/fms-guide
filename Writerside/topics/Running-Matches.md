1. Add all the teams. From the driver's perspective, station 1 is on the left and station 3 is on the right.
2. Bypass unused driver stations if fewer than 6 teams are present. To bypass, click the “Byp” button for the stations without a team assigned. This tells the FMS which driver stations are not being used in this match.
3. Check connections under “DS”, “Rad”, and “Rbt”. DS is the driver station, rad is radio, and rbt is robot.
4. Once everybody is connected, make sure that no one is on the field and the gates are closed. When ready and safe, click “Start Match”. There is no confirmation! If the start match button is disabled, the reason will be shown on the page.
5. Auto will start immediately when the match begins. Always ensure the robot is safely positioned before starting, as auto mode cannot be paused, and there is no warning when it begins.
6. Team e-stop acts as a stop during auto. Unlatch it before the auto period ends.
7. After the match is completed, click “Commit Results” to prepare the FMS for the next match.
