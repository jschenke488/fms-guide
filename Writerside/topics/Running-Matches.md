1. Add all the teams. From the perspective of a driver, station 1 is on the left, and station 3 on the right.
2. Bypass unused driver stations. Without a full 6 teams, you'll need to tell the FMS which driver stations are unused. You do this by bypassing a station. Click the button under "Byp" to bypass.
3. Check connections under "DS", "Rad", and "Rbt". DS is driver station, rad is radio, and rbt is robot.
4. Once everybody is connected, make sure that no one is on the field and the gates are closed. When ready and safe, click "Start Match". There is no confirmation!
5. After the match has completed, click "Commit Results" to load a new match.
