| FMS                 | Field Management System. The software that controls the electronics on the field.                                                                                                              |
| mini-SCC            | Mini Station Control Cabinet. A simplified version of the SCC used on a real _FIRST_ field.                                                                                                    |
| Scoring Table       | At an actual FIRST event, the table where the FMS is located on the opposite side of the field from the audience. In the shop, this is on the floor under the TV.                              |
| Driver Station (DS) | Computer running software to communicate between robots, drivers, and the FMS.                                                                                                                 |
| WPA Keys            | Wi-Fi passwords automatically generated for robots to connect to the field radio.                                                                                                              |
| WPA Kiosk           | Computer used to program a robot radio for use with the field.                                                                                                                                 |
| Scorekeeper         | Person responsible for managing the connected robots. In case of an emergency, you can disable ALL robots using the "scoring" e-stop button.                                                   |
| Field Radio         | Robots connect to Wi-Fi running on this device to communicate with driver stations and FMS.                                                                                                    |
| E-Stop              | Emergency Stop. Buttons located at every driver station and scoring table. Used to stop robots in case of an emergency. If not an emergency, press the Enter key on the driver station laptop. |
| Field Monitor       | A page to view information about all connected robots, and troubleshoot any connection issues.                                                                                                 |
